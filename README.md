# Messages

Messages is a Chrome app which combines multiple instant messaging networks into one.

This is not an official product by any of the messaging companies in this app. This was created as a free and open source project. 

## Introduction
Still quite new to Chrome Apps. A lot of the stuff like notifications is done through a crude hack. I'll revisit these at a later date. (Or if you want to help out, do a Pull Request!)

Currently supports the following IM networks:

  - Facebook Messenger
  - Hangouts
  - Skype
  - Whatsapp
  - WeChat

If you want any more IM networks being added, just submit an issue and it may be added; however, ensure a web version of the instant messenger is available.
